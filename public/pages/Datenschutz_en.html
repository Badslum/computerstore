        <p>This privacy policy informs you about which personal data we collect from you as part of our websites, our apps and the services we offer and how this data is processed and used. The protection of your personal data is important to us.</p>
        <p>Your data is protected against unauthorized access and loss by a variety of electronic, technical, physical, contractual and administrative measures. We have taken the necessary technical and organizational measures to ensure that data protection regulations are observed both internally and by external service providers.</p>
        <p>This Data Privacy Information contains transparent and clear information to ensure that visitors to our site and customers are well informed regarding the collection, processing and use of their personal data.</p>
        <h2 id="what-is-personal-data">What is personal data?</h2>
        <p>Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (e.g. name, address, telephone number, date of birth or email address).</p>
        <p>Protection of vital interests</p>
        <p>Art. 6, para 1 , lit. d GDPR serves as the legal basis should the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data.</p>

            <strong>
                <u>Usage data that is automatically collected</u>
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>Usage data is automatically collected when you use our websites; the information in these log files is automatically transmitted by your device.</p>
        <p>The following data is collected when you visit a website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>IP address of the computer from which the website was accessed</li>

        <h2 id="cookies">Cookies</h2>
        <p>We and our partners use cookies and similar technologies that fulfil the same functions as cookies (“Cookies”) in our Online Offer, among others to improve our Online Offer, to improve the user experience and to carry out personalised online advertising. Cookies are small text files that contain data from websites visited, e.g. the language settings on a website or the login status. Cookies are stored on your device by the browser you are using for their respective lifetime. Some Cookies are automatically deleted after the browser session has ended (“session” Cookies), while others are stored for a specified time or permanently in the user's browser and delete themselves automatically after the specified time has elapsed (“temporary” or “permanent” Cookies).</p>
        <p>We may sometimes request your consent for the use of Cookies by us and our partners to save and retrieve information on your device. If you provide your consent, we will process your data on the legal basis of the declared consent. In certain cases, the data processed using Cookies is processed based on our legitimate interests or those of our partners, or if the use of Cookies is essential to fulfil our contractual obligations to you (e.g. the secure operation of our Online Offer).</p>
        <p>You can revoke your consent to the use of Cookies at any time with effect for the future. To do this, simply change your selection in our cookie manager, which you can access via the "Cookie Settings" of our Online Offer.</p>
        <p>You can also disable the storage of Cookies in your browser settings and delete the Cookies saved in your browser at any time. However, please note that our Online Offer may not function, or only to a limited extent, without the use of Cookies.</p>
        <p>In addition, please note that objections to the use of Cookies are sometimes implemented through opt-out Cookies. Should you delete all the Cookies, any objections may therefore no longer be taken into account and must be obtained from you again.</p>
        <h2 id="period-of-storageretention-periods">Period of storage/retention periods</h2>
        <p>We store your data for as long as this is necessary for the provision of our Online Offer and the associated services, or if we have a legitimate interest in the further retention of such. In all other cases, we will delete your personal information except for data we may be required to retain in accordance with the contractual or statutory requirements (e.g. tax or commercial purposes, invoices, etc.). Contractual retention periods may also arise from contracts with third parties (e.g. owners of copyrights and ancillary copyrights). We will block any data that is subject to a retention period until the expiry of the relevant period.</p>
        <p>We generally store IP addresses and relevant Internet information for a period of up to six months. Should the stability and operational reliability of our system be compromised, or should a suspicion arise, we will store the respective log files for as long as necessary to ensure the security of the system or to clarify any suspected fraud.</p>
        <h2 id="it-security">IT security</h2>
        <p>With the help of an IT security provider, we use Cookies to collect and process specific data anonymously about the features of the terminal device used by the user (“device-specific data”), raw data from the TCP/IP connection and data on the use of our website to prevent the misuse of our services.</p>
        <p>Initially, the IP address is also collected and processed but encrypted within a few seconds. The information is stored with the IT security provider in a database for the prevention of fraud.</p>
        <p>If you conclude a contract on our website that involves a fee, or if the conclusion of a contract that involves a fee is approaching (e.g. at the beginning of the checkout process), we can access a risk evaluation regarding the terminal device you are using from the IT security provider's database which has been stored there.</p>
        <p>The risk evaluation is used, not exclusively, as a basis for deciding whether a contract for pecuniary interest can be concluded.</p>
        <p>Should we detect that a user is abusing, or has attempted to abuse, our services, we shall also transmit the data collected to the IT security provider.</p>
        <h2 id="right-of-revocation-deletion-of-data">Right of revocation, deletion of data</h2>
        <p>If you have given consent to process personal data, you can withdraw this consent at any time.</p>
        <p>Computerstore GmbH deletes your personal data insofar as it is no longer required or if you have requested the deletion of such data. Please note that data cannot be deleted if legal or other requirements to retain the data exist, or if we require the data to bill our services.</p>
        <h2 id="security-provisions">Security provisions</h2>
        <p>All the employees in our company receive regular training in data protection and are committed to data protection. Our computer centre and our in-house EDP department continuously adapt the technical security precautions to the current security conditions and requirements. Both are subject to constant monitoring by our internal procedures and the data protection officer. Nevertheless, Internet technologies may have security loopholes that cannot guarantee 100% full protection, and users can therefore submit data to us via other methods, e.g. fax.</p>
        <h2 id="changes-and-updates-to-the-data-privacy-information">Changes and updates to the Data Privacy Information</h2>
        <p>We would ask you to keep regularly informed regarding the content of this Data Privacy Information. We will amend this Data Privacy Information if any changes to the data processing carried out by us make this necessary. We will notify you when such changes require your cooperation (e.g. consent) or other individual notification.</p>
        <p>If we provide addresses and contact information of companies and organisations in this Data Privacy Information, please note that the addresses may change over time, so please check the information before contacting us.</p>
